hi its me astra
this file should only read once then exit the program. run it again to run the console
if you get any errors use pip to install discord.py and aioconsole
the file is at `./README.md` if you need to look at it again
to run the bot run the `./connect.sh` bash file
if you change the location of the `./connect.sh` file change the cd to point to wherever the home folder of this directory is
TOKEN.txt should just contain the token of the bot and nothing else
once the bot is running itll ask for a username; this is only used for setting the status of the bot
when talking, any input in the terminal that doesn't start with a `.` will send to the current channel the bot is in (if it can)
use `.server list` to list all servers the bot is in
use `.channel list` to list all channels the bot can see in the current server
use `.server <servername>` to change servers
use `.channel <channelname>` to change channels in the server
if you mistype and cant delete because something interrupted typing `.clear` anywhere in the message will make the current input do nothing
